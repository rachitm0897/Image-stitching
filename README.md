# Image Stitching
Image stitching is a computer vision technique that involves combining multiple images into a single, panoramic image. This README provides an overview of an image stitching project that utilizes different feature detection techniques, including SIFT, SURF, ORB, and BRISK. It also employs Brute Force matching and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) matching to align and blend images seamlessly.

# Introduction
Image stitching is used to create a composite image by aligning and blending multiple images, often taken from different viewpoints, into a single, wider image. This technique is commonly used in panoramic photography and photogrammetry. In this project, we leverage feature detection algorithms and matching techniques to enable precise alignment and blending.

# Feature Detection Techniques
**SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**:
SIFT is a robust and widely used feature detection technique. It identifies key points and their descriptors in images, making it invariant to scale, rotation, and partial occlusion.

**SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)**:
SURF is another popular technique for feature detection. It focuses on finding interest points and descriptors. SURF is known for its efficiency and good performance in various scenarios.

**ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**:
ORB is an open-source and efficient feature detection algorithm. It is a fusion of FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor with a modification to make it rotation-invariant.

**BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints)**:
BRISK is a feature detection method designed for real-time applications. It employs a binary descriptor that is robust to noise and illumination changes.

# Feature Matching
To align and blend images effectively, this project uses two feature matching techniques:

**Brute Force Matching**: Brute force matching computes the distance between all feature descriptors in the reference and target images and finds the closest match. While simple, this method can be time-consuming for large datasets.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Matching**: K-NN matching is a more efficient approach that finds the k closest feature descriptors in the reference image for each descriptor in the target image. It offers a balance between accuracy and speed.

# Image Blending
After successfully matching features between images, the next step involves warping the images to align them correctly. To ensure a smooth transition and eliminate visible creases, we apply image blending techniques. The blending may include simple averaging, gradient-based blending, or more advanced methods like multi-band blending.
